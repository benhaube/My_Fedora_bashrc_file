# My_Fedora_bashrc_file

This is the .bashrc file that I use on my Fedora systems. It contains all the alias' that I use. 

# Install the bashrc file

To install the bashrc file you first need to backup the original file
* Open a terminal window in your home directory and run the command <cp -r .bashrc .bashrc.bak>
* Open your Files app and use the keyboard shortcut '<ctrl> + h' to show hidden files. 
* Add a '.' in front of the file name of my bashrc file to make it a hidden file. 
* Copy my bashrc file into your home directory and allow it to overwrite the original.
* Close any open terminal windows and relaunch the terminal. The new terminal windows will now open with the new bashrc file. 

You can always revert to the original bashrc file that you made a backup of by deleting the new .bashrc file in the home directory and removing the '.bak' from the original that you backed up.
